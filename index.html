    <h3> After getting my sock from Harry, taking over Queens-Landing (John Snow knew nothing, I tell ya) and bringing down the Capitol - I was backpacking across Western Europe. I was just outside Barcelona, hiking in the foothills of mount Tibidabo when...</h3> 
   
    <div class="lake">
     <p>...I was at the end of this path, and I came to a clearing, and there was a lake, very secluded, and there were tall trees all around.
         <br> It was dead silent. Gorgeous.
         <br>
      As I approached the Lake, I noticed three seperate containers floating on the surface of the water, proceeded by a small note laying next to it:</p>
        
        <div class="path">Noble elevenfold Path : the extended manual to enlightment (steps 9,10,11)
            <br>
        Love, Buddha x </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="red circle">Dive into Finance</div>
            <div class="yellow circle"> Immerse into Marketing + Sales</div>
            <div class="green circle">Progress to Programming</div>
            
        </div>
      
        <div class="wisdom">
            <p>After some deliberation ( and drinking the water of the lake; which may or may not have been hallucinogenic), I decided to follow the wisdom of the floating containers:</p>
            <br>
            <ul > 
                <li>I first studied Finance in university</li>
                <li>I graduated and went on to work in Marketing and Sales roles</li>
                <li>and now, <span> I am just a girl- standing infront of the chosing commitee, asking for you to take her into the programme.</span> </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>  
</main>


<ol><span>Once I join Coders and Founders :</span>
    <li>I will become a part of a like-minded driven and a creative community - that I can collaborate with and in return help grow .
    <li> I will gain the skills necessary to bring ideas "to life"" in the digital space, join innovative teams- and help bring the future a little closer into reach.
    <li>I will finally complete the project I had in mind for years and possibly take over the world.
</ol>

        <li>Sing songs and dance against the background of the setting sun.</li>
        <li>Scribble and paint things on papaer- things that we can later create in code online!</li>
